# FeatHub SDK

FeatHub empowers users to define features using a Pythonic and declarative SDK
with built-in functions, allowing recursive feature creation based on existing
definitions.

Compared to SQL-based SDKs, FeatHub's Pythonic SDK seamlessly integrates with
Python-focused machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and PyTorch.
Python's expressiveness, including for-loops and if/else statements, leads to
more concise and readable feature definition code, especially for a multitude
of similar patterned features.
